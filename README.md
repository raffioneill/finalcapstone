FINANCE CALCULATOR READ ME

This Python code is a simple financial calculator that prompts the user to 
choose between an investment or bond type and performs calculations based on the input.

If the user inputs "investment," the program asks for the deposit amount, 
estimated interest rate, estimated years invested, and interest type (simple or compound). 
Depending on the interest type selected, the program calculates the total amount after the given period, 
at the specified interest rate, using the appropriate formula. The result is then printed.

If the user inputs "bond," the program asks for the value of the house, 
interest rate, and the number of months. 
The program then calculates the monthly repayment amount using the appropriate formula and prints the result.

If the user inputs any other value, the program prints "Invalid."

Overall, the code allows the user to perform simple financial calculations based 
on the selected investment or bond type, and the input provided.
